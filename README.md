What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The purpose of the projects in this course was to creat code that was able to sort and print a course list

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I used vector sorting for this product. This is the method that I understood most. It is important to understand so you can be sure every piece of data is sorted

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

While going through the activities and projects I utilized YouTube and my great tutor. I also reflected back on zyBooks.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I am more comfortable with sorting. I never did this leveled of detail with code. I filled almost an entire notebook with notes so I feel more prepared for the professional world now.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I use less code now. My code is also able to pick out data more and do exactly what is needed to be done. I spent so many hours taking notes to be able to excel my code. I learned a lot.
